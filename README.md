DESCRIPTION:  This project is a simple Python-based tool to detect file modifications using hash comparison.
              It uses the SHA-256 algorithm from Pythonâ€™s hashlib library to generate hash values.
              The script calculates the original hash of a file (or text) and compares it later to detect changes.
              If the hash changes, a warning is shown indicating the file may have been tampered with.
              The tool simulates file content in Google Colab using string variables.
              Google Colab was chosen for development due to its browser-based convenience.
              The final code was exported and uploaded to GitHub as part of internship submission.
              GitHub was used to store the .py file and documentation (README.md).
              This project demonstrates basic file integrity concepts used in cybersecurity.
